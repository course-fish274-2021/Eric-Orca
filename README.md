This project is based on data from Urchin data for repository from figshare by Isabelle Cote.The daata includes results of all behavioural tests performed on red sea urchins: unmanipulated wild, handled wild, and handled and captive returned to the wild.

The script of the project is in the script folder within the main folder.
In this project, I will be working on: 1.interpreting the relationship between the size of sea urchin and the speed of their predator flight response.2.comparing wild Urchins and handled Urchins in terms of flight response.

This project is based on data from Urchin data for repository from figshare by Isabelle Cote.The daata includes results of all behavioural tests performed on red sea urchins: unmanipulated wild, handled wild, and handled and captive returned to the wild.

The script of the project is in the script folder within the main folder.
In this project, I will be working on: 1.interpreting the relationship between the size of sea urchin and the speed of their predator flight response.2.comparing diameter of Urchins after days of capture to first day of capture and wild controls.
